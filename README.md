# MBran Content Module

MBran Content Module is an Umbraco plugin that let developers create a clean code and reusable modules rather than a template-based page rendering. It aims to set a coding standard for module content, minimize hard-coded partial view paths and provide an easier and cleaner way to write business logic on the controller than on the views. 

Features:
1. Auto-wiring of IPublished content to view paths, models and controller. 
2. Ability to override module view per rendering doc type (page)
3. Ability to override the default module view on a different folder
